# 8fit onboarding process
This project is a clone of an onboarding process of a popular fitness app 8fit.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Version and Enivronment Info:</strong><br/>
react-native-cli: 2.0.1<br/>
react-native: 0.55.4<br/>
OS: Windows 10 Pro<br/>
<br/>
The project is created and bootstrapped using <strong>react-native init</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Build Instructions:</strong><br/>
After cloning/downloading, point to the directory from command prompt, and then enter,
<br/><br/>
<strong>npm install</strong>
<br/><br/>
It will install the dependencies. I have used only one external package "react-navigation" for handling screens navigations and that is also been mentioned in package.json under dependencies.<br/>
<br/>
Once dependencies are installed hit command <strong>react-native run-(android OR ios)</strong>. This will run the app to a simulator or a device.
