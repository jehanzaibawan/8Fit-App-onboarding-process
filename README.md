# 8FitTask

<strong>Version and Enivronment Info:</strong><br/>
react-native-cli: 2.0.1<br/>
react-native: 0.55.4<br/>
OS: Windows 10 Pro<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Build Instructions:</strong><br/>
After cloning/downloading, point to the directory from command prompt, and then enter,
<br/><br/>
<strong>npm install</strong>
<br/><br/>
It will install the dependencies. I have used only one external package "react-navigation" for handling screens navigations and that is also been mentioned in package.json under dependencies.<br/>
<br/><br/>
<strong>Thoughts about how you think the task went?</strong><br/>
I have put every effort to complete this task with perfection and within time. Yet, achieving perfection is an ongoing process, and there is no end to it.
<br/><br/>
I have worked on organizing the project structure to be more self-explanatory, defined components with respect to their types(avoided using states where possible), created stateless functional components and stateful components both, their reusability and written less code and achieved more.
<br/><br/>
Each component is tasteable, defined with default propProps and enforces propTypes with types and required a tag.
<br/><br/>
I have performed app performance test on various android devices(phones only), however, due to lack of resources(Mac(for XCode), iPhone) I was not able to test it on this system. I believe things will work the same on these devices to as I have written very limited platform-specific code, and where appears it is enclosed with Platform API.
<br/><br/>
Last but not least, I have set useNativeDriver: true in every animation to bypass the instructions and not to overhead the bridge with transmitting animations messages back and forth(frame by frame) and off course for the performance difference.
<br/><br/>
At last, I enjoyed doing this task, liked your design and concept very much and I hope I have done justice with completing this task to :)
<br/><br/>
Thank you!
